The Fresh Fork offers a unique take on the restaurant scene, providing prepared
meals in microwaveable containers. Customers use the website to place their
order and then either pick up their food or have it delivered. With multiple
delivery services available in-town, this strategy drastically cuts down on
their payroll. It also, however, puts a great deal of responsibility on the
website to function correctly and timely.

## Technical Challenges

The main challenges the project invoked were from the ordering process of The
Fresh Fork. They sort their menu items by proteins, carbs, and veggies, and each
week they offer a different assortment of menu items from each category. They
typically have their menus up for at least 3 weeks.
