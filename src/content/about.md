# About Me

## Hi, I'm David Carter

I am the Director of Technical Services at [Tribeswell](//tribeswell.com) in Bloomington, Indiana. My favorite part of going to work is developing complex websites and solving all of the creative problems that arise in the process. I also handle ongoing maintenance like plugin updates and adding new features to sites, among other responsibilities. At home, I keep up with the latest trends by trying out all of the different JS frameworks and static site generators, continually learning from online courses such as those from [Wes Bos](//wesbos.com/courses/) and [Egghead](//egghead.io), and reading the latest articles on [/r/webdev](//reddit.com/r/webdev) and twitter for example.

When I'm not on my computer, you'll find me with my two favorite girls in the world, my life partner and [my dog](//instagram.com/piglet_petite). We all love going for long walks in the woods, but also just chilling on the couch with some Netflix and YouTube. The human duo of our trio enjoy bourbon and craft beer. This year, we finished the Bourbon Trail and I started brewing my own beer.

I'm probably a little too obsessed with the Denver Broncos. I have nearly every kind of apparel with their logo on it. Everyone around me growing up was such a huge fan of Kobe that eventually my favorite basketball team became tonight's opponent of the Lakers. I follow the Blackhawks because they were the local team when I started watching hockey, although I still barely know what's going on. I'm not the biggest fan of baseball, save the World Series, but I'll always root for the Dodgers.
